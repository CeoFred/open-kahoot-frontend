## First Time Contributor

<!-- Helpful links and things the contributor should know about contributing to the project: Like our stack (Next.js, TailwindCSS, Git, GitHub etc.), helpful links on setting up and working with each tool in the stack -->

We use the following tools on this codebase:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React Framework. [This helpful guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgC9mj0qv972IO5DmD-H0ZH) covers the basics
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid prototyping. [Learn how to use it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo)
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) - To manage githooks
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - To check for and prevent human errors in the codebase
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - To maintain proper formatting in the codebase
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - To store updates to the codebase in commits. Here are a few basic tips to keep in mind
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - For collaboration. [Here's a crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE) that covers the basics
- You are free to use any code editor you want; however, we strongly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for a good developer experience

## Getting Started

### Finding an Issue

<!-- A concise guide to finding an issue on the repo -->
<!-- Here, you can talk about the different labels on the project and what they mean. I think you should also add that if the contributor finds a new issue, they should comment on it and get approval first -->

Here's a complete list of our frontend's [open issues](https://github.com/quizardhq/frontend/issues).

We use labels to indicate each issue's priority, status, and beginner-friendliness. Look out for some of these labels:

**Issues available for community contribution**

The following tags mark issues that are open for community contribution:

- **good first issue** -> Open to participation from the community and friendly towards new contributors
- **help wanted** -> Open to participation from the community but not necessarily beginner-friendly

Once you've found an issue you would like to work on, check out our [contribution process](#contribution-process) to get started

**Issues not available for community contribution**

The following tags mark issues that are _not_ open for community contribution:

- **ðŸ”’ core team only** -> To work on this, you need to join the core team

**Issues not ready to be worked on yet**

The following tags mark issues that are not ready to be worked on yet:

- **ðŸš§ status: blocked** -> Blocked by other work that needs to be done first
- **ðŸ§¹ status: ticket work required** -> Needs additional work before it is ready to be taken up

### Contribution Process

<!-- How to get started with contributing once you find an issue -->

<!-- commenting on an issue and getting it assigned to you -->
<!-- forking and cloning the repo -->
<!-- creating a separate branch for each feature and making changes as required using a mobile-first approach -->
<!-- sending a pull request -->

**Picking an issue to work on**

<!-- Comment on the issue and get it assigned to you first -->

**Forking and cloning the repo**

<!-- Click the fork icon at the top right corner of the project and fork the repo -->
<!-- In your fork, click the code button, and copy the git URL to clone to your local PC. See how to clone here -->

**Working on your chosen issue in a separate branch**

<!-- Create a branch with feat/refactor/bugfix/docs... following these concise branching guidelines -->

**Sending a pull request**

<!-- Send a pull request from your branch to the repo's staging branch -->

### Proposing a New Issue

<!-- Didn't find an issue? How to raise a new one -->

If you discover any bugs or possible improvements while going through the project, **check the list of open issues first** to see if someone else has already proposed it.

You can **only** file a bug report or suggest a new feature **if no open issues exist addressing it**.
